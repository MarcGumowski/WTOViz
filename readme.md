WTOViz
============

**WTOViz** gathers a collection of visualizations (several from other repositories) grouped into slides using reveal.js.

Trade statistics used to build the visualizations come from the World Tariff Profile 2017 publication and can be found in the databases of the WTO, ITC or UNCTAD. More information on the WTO web site: [**Statistics**](https://www.wto.org/statistics).
